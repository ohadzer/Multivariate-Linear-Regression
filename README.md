# Multivariate-Linear-Regression

In this project I performed the following:
1. Compute the cost and perform gradient descent in pure numpy in vectorized form.
2. Fit a linear regression model using a single feature.
3. Visualize the results using matplotlib.
4. Perform multivariate linear regression.
5. Pick the best three features in the dataset
